        <p>Douglas Adams, the answer is 42.. how did you get there? addition? subtraction? multiplication? a mixture of the lot?</p>
        <p>You might ask, “Formulas have been developed for that”, and youre right, some dead white guys needed to “prove” their equations did something if you have a very specific type of data.</p>
        <p>The problem is that we are living in a rapidly evolving world, with new kind of data being generated every day. We need to be able to analyze this new kind of data. Formula applies to a very narrow range of data. We are not living in a fantasy world.</p>
        <p>I am not here to train you to be a bunch of robots who know how to apply some recipe by heart and just press a button and just read the results.</p>
        I am here is to train the next generation of scientists, the next generation of entrepreneurs, the next generation of leader, who will be able to understand to analyze any kind of new data they encounter.

        <aside class="notes">
        <p>Cholera has been one of most virulent killers in history.</p>
        <p>Millions succumbed to the 7 cholera pandemics since the first in 1817.</p>
        <p>It became the first truly global disease and also the most feared.</p>
        Symptoms of this disease include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and a horribly violent case of diarrhea that can cause one to lose as much as 20 liters of fluid and electrolytes per day, leading to extremely severe dehydration.
        <p>The first outbreak began in India early in the 19th century and spread to England in 1831 in the first of four 19th century epidemics occurring in 18311833, 18481850, 18531854, and 1866.</p>
        <br>In part as a result of choleras mortality rate of between 20 and 25 percent, the nature of cholerawas it air or waterborneand the means of its diffusion were subjects of intense professional debate.

        A British physician, considered one of the fathers of modern epidemiology.

        <p>
        He was <span class="warning">skeptical</span> of the Miasma theory and proposed a different hypothesis: <span class="info fragment">that cholera was attributable to a self-replicating agent, probably ingested through contaminated <span class="warning">water</span>.</span>

        <aside class="notes">
        <p>Being skeptic, curious, not taking anything for granted is a good quality to have.</p>
        <p>The first cases of cholera in England were reported in 1831, about the time Dr. Snow as finishing up his medical studies at the age of eighteen. Between 1831 and 1854, tens of thousands of people in England died of cholera. Although Dr. Snow was deeply involved in experiments using a new technique, known as anesthesia, to deliver babies, he was also fascinated with researching his theory on how cholera spread.</p>
        <p>In the middle 1800s, people didnt have running water or modern toilets in their homes. They used town wells and communal pumps to get the water they used for drinking, cooking and washing. Septic systems were primitive and most homes and businesses dumped untreated sewage and animal waste directly into the Thames River or into open pits called “cesspools”. Water companies often bottled water from the Thames and delivered it to pubs, breweries and other businesses.</p>
        <p>Dr. Snow believed sewage dumped into the river or into cesspools near town wells could contaminate the water supply, leading to a rapid spread of disease.</p>
        In August of 1854 Soho, a suburb of London, was hit hard by a terrible outbreak of cholera. Dr. Snows himself lived near Soho, and immediately went to work to prove his theory that contaminated water was the cause of the outbreak.

        <p>By the arrival of the 19th century, the River Thames had become the most contaminated river in the world.</p>
        <p>Toilets were widely introduced in London between 1830 and 1850: main sewers were introduced in the 1840s.</p>
        <p>The sewers, elongated cesspools with overflows at the end emptied into the River Thames, which was also a dumping ground for animal and industrial wastes.</p>
        When ships were coming to harbor, crew started to develop cholera symptom only when they were going in contact with people of the city.

        <p>By the middle of the 19th century, Soho had become an insanitary place of cow-sheds, animal droppings, slaughterhouses, grease-boiling dens and primitive, decaying sewers. And underneath the floorboards of the overcrowded cellars lurked something even worse – a fetid sea of cesspits as old as the houses, and many of which had never been drained. It was only a matter of time before this hidden festering time-bomb exploded.</p>
        <p>Soho was the neighborhood of John Snow.</p>
        <p>First hand case study for him.</p>
        <p>In Snows days, the science of public health and statistics, epidemiology, was not established.</p>
        <p>He collected epidemiological evidence in a bid to convince other practitioners of his theory of cholera.</p>
        <p>When you want to study something, you need data.</p>
        <p>Kind of data Snow was collecting going door to door.</p>
        <p>Usually data is stored and presented in a dataset, comprised of variables measured on observational units (or cases).</p>
        <p>In any dataset, it is important to understand exactly what each variable is measuring and how the values are coded. First column is usually used to provide an identifier for each of the individuals in the study (House number).</p>
        We see that there are different types of variables. Categories and numbers.

        <p>Snow employed network analysis to calculate which water pump was closest to each house.</p>
        <p>The stroke of genius: he based it on walking distance, not as-the-crow-flies distance.</p>
        <p>He then used polygons to demarcate areas based on those findings. Because he added foot traffic to the equation, the output yielded a shape that clearly illustrated the relationship between human movement and disease.</p>
        It was impossible to deny the high concentration of fatalities in the population that was drinking Broad Street water. This map helped convince the local authorities that cholera was waterborne.

            Clearly, this would have been unethical and certainly illegal. He did, however, recognize that allocation and near-randomization had taken place in a natural setting, and had taken advantage of this historical occurrence to test his hypothesis.
